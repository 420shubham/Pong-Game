# Pong-Game
Made using turtle module in python.

This was a challenging one as the movement of the ball is pretty hard to imagine without a grid in the screen.

There maybe two methods on how the ball bounces one is by changing the sign of x-axis when the ball hits the wall and changing the sign of y-axis when ball hits the paddle.
The other way is by changing the heading direction of the ball we can subtract the heading direction from 360 when it hits the wall and subtract the heading from 180 when it hits any of the paddle.

I found the concept of angles and how it changes very intresting while creating this game.

Please enjoy the game and feel free to suggest any changes.

HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!!!!!
